# Javascript ISO country codes

This is a simple script to help converting from/to ISO country codes. It uses the free downloadable CSV file from https://countrycode.org.

## Flags

There's also a neat script to convert alpha-2 ISO country codes to flags indexes in an image. See `/flags` (and also see https://www.flag-sprites.com/).
